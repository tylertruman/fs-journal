## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value, Reference, and Pointer. A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. Reference types don't store its value directly, instead it stores the address where the value is being stored. Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, and ushort. The differences from JavaScript that I notice are I have no idea what a lot of these value types mean, whereas a few like bool I assume are just shorthands for the types I am familiar with.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types get stored in a different place than the value. And then references the place where the value is stored. It differs from Value types because in Value types everything is stored in the same place.
