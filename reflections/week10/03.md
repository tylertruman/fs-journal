## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

A column contains attributes whereas a row contains the data for the columns. (Rows are known as records and the columns are known as fields.)

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

The column would contain the attributes(ex: name, age, description, int). And the row would contain the values of those attributes.

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Delete from removes all the rows from an existing table while keeping the table and its columns in tact. Whereas Drop removes the entire table.
