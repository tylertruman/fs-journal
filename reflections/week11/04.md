## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course has helped me confidence in my ability to learn. My biggest concern is the technical interviews, I know I am good at problem solving and finding creative solutions but the technical stuff is more difficult, especially in an interview setting where I become anxious. I plan to manage my time as best I can to keep me on track throughout the rest of the course and after. It's hard to say what I enjoyed most during the course because I do like working across the full stack. But I would have to say the back end is nice because there are less ways to solve problems making it easier to solve them.
