## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication is always important on anything involving more than 1 person. Good communication is important because it can prevent errors due to miscommunication being fairly common. 

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Shorter meetings or less meetings could make the agile methodology more effective due to the smaller team size. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle refers to the fact that high quality goods delivered quickly and efficiently to clients/customers will always come at a higher price and vice versa. (Not unlike the phrase you get what you pay for.) Quality costs time and money, speed costs more employees or better equipment(more money). And price is reflective of the cost to create a product.
