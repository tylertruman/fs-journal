## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing, Component Testing, & End-To-End (E2E) Testing. Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. Component tests are framework specific, and they provide component tests that have optimal compatibility with the Vue ecosystem. E2E Tests are the biggest as they test end to end, all code included.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

They all are! But if I had to choose one it would be E2E as it tests whether or not your application works as a whole.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Component testing. Because I would assume it is the least useful/used testing system in the world of software development.
