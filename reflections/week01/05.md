# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Web Design (including mobile responsiveness).

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I am building my first checkpoint and it's going better than expected. The mobile responsiveness took a little bit of time but I figured it out just before lab ended.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?


- What are you struggling with?

Getting my Bootstrap grid items exactly where I want them quickly and efficiently.

- What would you count as a victory?

I would count the knowledge that I have gained in the past week a huge victory. There is still a lot to learn but as long as I am learning it's progress.
