## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element or elements. I think the most common pseudo-classes that I will use are :link, :hover, and :visited.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit? 

Specificity is built into CSS to determine which rule should be applied if multiple rules are targeting both the same element and property on that element but are assigning different values. You can use it to your benefit by knowing the rules of CSS Specificity so that you don't accidentally overwrite previous values and have to waste time finding and fixing the issue.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you over-utilize the !important feature you may accidentally change the value of something you don't want to change. And the only way to override an !important rule is with another !important rule with the same or higher specificity. Which can make the code confusing and difficult to debug.

Coding is hard, especially when you are trying to replicate an example image of a webpage. I found it helpful to comment out code when I ran into an issue as a way to find the problem and fix it.
