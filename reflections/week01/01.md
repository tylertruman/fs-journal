## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git to keep track of coding projects and the changes to them in one place. It also allows us to save them which allows us to revert to an older version of a project if need be. It makes working with multiple developers more efficient because it can show multiple developers the current and previous versions of the project.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
