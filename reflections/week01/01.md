## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git to store and keep track of code and the changes to that code in one place. It also maintains the history of saves and the changes that developers make, which gives us the ability to revert to an older version of a project if need be. It makes working with multiple developers more efficient because it can show multiple developers the current and previous versions of the project as well as create branches so that multiple people can work on the same code without messing with someone elses work.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple branches allow developers to work on 2 or more copies of the same project so that you can test code or code independently without messing with someone elses code. You can also compare the branches to see the differences/similarities and even merge the branches together.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a software system that tracks and stores your code locally on your device whereas GitHub is an online web service that hosts your Git repositories online.
