## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

The purpose of wireframing is to provide a clear overview of the project that you are wireframing for.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are three main levels of wireframes: low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity.

 Low-fidelity wireframes are useful for sketching ideas or if you want speed as they are the very basic visual representations of the webpage and usually serve as a starting point.

 Mid-fidelity wireframes are useful for more accurate representations of the layout. They usually have more detail assigned to specific components and are made using a digital wireframing tool.

 High-fidelity wireframes are useful for the most accurate representations of the layout that can even be pixel-specific making High-fidelity wireframes the go to for complex concepts.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think it depends. 

Low-fidelity? Why not, its very efficient and you can use it as a rough guide to help you layout your webpage. 

Mid-fidelity? If it's for a big project, yes, otherwise it might not be worth the time and effort.

High-fidelity? If I want something perfect and I don't care how much time it takes, high-fidelity could be an option.

In the end I think it depends on way too many variables to say whether wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort without knowing the specific goals of the project.

Fix problems early as they can be more difficult to solve once you add in a lot more code.
