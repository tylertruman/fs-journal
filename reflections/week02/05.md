# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I was able to get most of the functionality finished for my checkpoint 2 in lab on Friday.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

How quickly you can learn in a coding bootcamp. It's crazy to me that I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript in just two weeks. 

- What are you struggling with?

Memorizing the more complex syntax in JavaScript so that I don't need to reference.

- What would you count as a victory?

The knowledge I have gained this week and my checkpoint 2 project.
