## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is where the variables are available for use. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let will be useful for when you want something block scoped while maintaining the ability to be updated but not re-declared. 

const will be useful for when you want something block scoped and not updatable or re-declarable.

var will be useful when you want something globally scoped, updatable, and re-declarable.
