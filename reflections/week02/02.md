## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

A function declaration is written by using the function keyword followed by the name of the function. 

A function expression is written by keeping the keyword function to the right side of a = .

An arrow function expression is written by using an => after the parameters. 

A function declaration defines a named function and hoists the function definition allowing the function to be used before it is defined. 

A function expression defines a named or anonymous function. Function Expressions are not hoisted, so they cannot be used before they are defined. 

An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to the others listed here, but limited and can't always be used. 

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used when defining a function. Arguments are the values that the function receives from each parameter when the function is invoked. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

a higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as a parameter or returns another function. An example would be using forEach() after an anonymous function.
