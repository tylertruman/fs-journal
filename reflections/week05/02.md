## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One-To-One (1:1), One-To-Many (1:N), and Many-To-Many (N:M).

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

It is similar to how traditional relational databases would store data, and is better for One-To-Many.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Deciding which management system works best with the data you are trying to manage and what the category of your document will be, and what will be stored within.
