## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by adding that info to the end of a URL.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

Queries start with a ?, and after that comes the query string portion of the URL such as ?color=blue. color=blue is key=value pair. You use the & sign to query multiple things. 

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Key names should make sense to allow for easier querying.
