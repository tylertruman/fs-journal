## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is a pair (2) of programmers working on a single workstation. One is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator". The driver is behind the wheel, actively coding. And the navigator focuses on the overall direction of the project.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Increase in quality of code. Better transfer of skills and a reduction in coordination efforts as both programmers are working together on the same workstation.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Can cause conflict if the pair isn't compatible or if they have different opinions on the direction of the project. Can waste time if the pair doesn't work well together. So in the end, most of the drawbacks come down to the pairs incompatibility/skill levels.
