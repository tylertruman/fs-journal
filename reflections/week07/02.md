## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is the act of writing notes and documentation explaining the not so obvious aspects of your code. You can write this documentation inside the source, or the README for the repo.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

Code documentation makes your code more easily understandable and readable. Not only to colleagues, but to yourself after not viewing the project after a period of time.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Very important, because for most projects the code will be read by multiple people, so to understand certain aspects could be difficult for someone who didn't write said code.
